One of the things I have always enjoyed about what I do is that I have,
from pretty much day 1 in the technology industry, worn many hats.

No matter what my job title said, I have always done pretty much
whatever needs doing whether or not it crosses into what others might
consider a discipline that's not in my job description.

I like it that way. I enjoy picking up new skills, flexing my mental
muscles in new ways and exploring the uncharted territory that is every
new technology to rise out of the primordial ooze of Github (Or
Sourceforge before it).

Way back in 1992 when I got my first job in the technology industry, I
met a very wise man named Dale Dougherty (I hope I'm not mangling the
spelling, it's been over two decades! (If you're out there Dale, give me
a holler will you? I'd love to get back in touch) and when he asked what
it was that had driven me into technology, and after I told him in the
naescent, halting terms I could form at the time he smiled and said "Ah!
You're a generalist. Unfortunately, those are undervalued these days.
It's a great shame" or something to that effect.

Boy was he right. For the next 20 years I would end up doing tech
support, sysadmin work, software development, and finally release
engineering.

The industry began throwing up high walls and fences around places
and processes we all used to take for granted.  "You can't do that,
you're not a **developer**!" "Only **sysadmins** get root and access to
production machines!" "You're a **release engineer**, not a developer!"
Ad infinitum.

Fast forward to 2009 when folks came up with the DevOps manifesto, in
which a positively radical idea is proposed: All these distinctions are
useless. They do nothing to make organizations more efficient, and
instead bottleneck and pigeon hole good people, keeping them from
feeding their passion.

Needless to say, I love it here. I get to bring all the experience
I've accumulated in 20 years hard labor in the code mines to bear, and
it feels **really** good.

I'm building infrastructure in the cloud, learning about load
balancing, high availability and I've just barely begun.

As much as the layoff I just went through was painful as they always
are, that moment of dislocation pales in comparison to the satisfaction
I feel in what I have accomplished in the few short months I've been
doing this, and the **incredible** excitement I feel as my horizons have
been exponentially broadened.

As I write this, I'm several thousand feet up, bouncing along over the
clouds on my way to Santa Clara, California for the annual Velocity
conference.

It's an incredible meeting where some of the best and brightest in our
industry come together to make the web go faster and more reliably, and
I can't wait to dive in and start learning :)

[*Update: I'm posting this weeks later, because things get hectic. Such
is life. Velocity was amazing.  Look for another post on that coming
soon.]*
