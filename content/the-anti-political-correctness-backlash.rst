Since when did "**Happy Holidays"**\ become persona non grata?

I realize that for many people, it is the epitome of bland political correctness – however for me, it’s what I **want** to say!

I don’t want to wish you a Merry Christmas, or a happy Channukah, or a blessed Ramadan, because I don’t know if you celebrate any of those things. What I\ **do** want to say is that I hope you have a happy, enjoyable, peaceful and serene holiday with your friends, family, or whoever else it is you enjoy having around.

So, Happy Holidays!

That's all :)
