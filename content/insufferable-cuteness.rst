| We are dog sitting for one of my wife's co-workers this weekend. He's a big lovable Golden named Buddy, and I am totally smitten :)

As anyone who knows me can attest, I was owned by a Golden for years back in my pre college days, and I've been wanting another one ever since.

Happily, my wife is also an easy mark for such a big adorable fluff ball, so I might have a shot at it :)

Time to go take our after dinner walk.
