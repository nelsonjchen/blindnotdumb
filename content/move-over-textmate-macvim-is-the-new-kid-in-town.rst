| For years I've been rather proud of the fact that I'm a total polyglot when it
| comes to editors. I'm comfortable on both sides of the fence, using Emacs, Vi,
| TextMate, EditPlus, or even the venerable /bin/ed whenever that makes sense.
| 
| But for the first time in a long time, my current (awesome! :)) job at `Blue
  State Digital <http://www.bluestatedigital.com>`__ has given me the opportunity to
| branch out and do quite a bit of real software development.

| I first encountered TextMate shortly after I came to OSX. It's a great editor,
| and I have a tremendous amount of respect for Alan Odegard of `Macromates <http://www.macromates.com>`__
| software. He has just about single handedly created not only an amazing
| editor, but a vibrant and loyal community around his program, and he's to be
| commended for that.

| I would have remained happy in TextMate land, but for the fact that my most
| recent job has me going back to where it all started for me - server side UNIX,
| Linux to be exact.

| So, I editing files on my Mac using Expandrive to remotely mount them, but
| quite frankly that's a pain in the neck I just don't need to deal with.

| With Vim, I can memorize one set of keystrokes for everywhere I might need to
| be.

| And with MacVim, I get a nicely streamlined, beautifully Aqua-fied interface,
| with all the creature comforts TextMate provides and more.

| What's more, there are a number of folks making the same transition, so there
| are some excellent articles and websites out there to ease the transition like
| `this guide on making the
  switch <http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/09/05/textmate-to-vim.html#masthead>`__ or
| the excellent `VimCasts <http://vimcasts.org>`__ series of Vim tutorial screen
| casts. They cover everything from the basics to some fairly advanced tips and
| tricks on more complex Vim modes and integrations, and is written by a TextMate
| to Vim switcher.

| Right now I'm writing this post on the excellent
| `VimRePress <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3510>`__ plugin for
| Vim that allows you to author and manage your Wordpress blog right from within
| the editor! Very sweet :)

| So, it's a brave new world, and I'm excited by the opportunity to get
| **really** good at Vim so I can push my editing productivity through the roof
| :)
