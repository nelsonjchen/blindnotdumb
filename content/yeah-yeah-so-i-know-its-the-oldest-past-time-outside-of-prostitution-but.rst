I've just **gotta** say that the *constant* thunder, lightning, and torrential rain storms can stop any time now.  Really, we are in zero danger of droubt, and the summer is trickling away.

I go on vacation starting tomorrow evening, so I will be praying to any deity I think will listen for a break in this weather and a return to the sunny summer currently (not!) in progress :)

I know, like you all are just thrilled to be listening to me kvetch.  I'll stop now.

(Yay, impending vacation - no matter what the weather it will be fun!)
