Over a month ago now, my wife and I went on vacation with her boss and
friend and another friend of hers to Ireland...

We took the CIE 'A Taste of Ireland" bus tour, and had an amazing time.
This was my first trip to Europe, and unsurprisingly, I found it
amazing.

Ireland is definitely a party country, if there could be said to be such
a thing :) It seemed like there were Guinness taps everywhere. Being  
rather a fan, this could hardly be considered a problem for me :)

Speaking of Guinness, on our first day we visited the Guinness brewery
in St. James Gate. The initial 'tour' is kind of neat, although mostly
just  
multimedia presentations and the like about how it's made. The real
bonanza however, and the reason that I feel no Guinness fan should miss
a visit,  
is the 'Gravity Bar' on the top floor of the brewery. You only get 1
pint of Guinness (probably to cut down on loitering and move people
through) but  
I have to say it's the best pint I've ever tasted. Most of the other
pubs we visited had fine Guinness, but really it wasn't particularly any
more  
tasty than a pint drawn at a really good pub here in the US that knows
how to handle its Guinness.

The bus tour itself was incredible, but a bit grueling. A typical day
involved getting up at 6:30 to get to breakfast at 7:30 so we could pile
onto  
the bus for 8:00. After that, it was a dizzying whirl wind of
destinations and picture taking, and usually around 5:30 in the evening
they'd dump  
us at our destination where we'd be staying for the night, and we'd all
crawl away to freshen up and try to recover enough to enjoy the
evening's  
festivities :) In addition to the sheer endurance required for the
trip, we definitely experienced the expected feeling that in a number of
cases,  
we would have \*REALLY\* liked to have more time to explore (For
instance we never kissed the Blarney Stone because we had exactly 2.5
hours to  
have lunch, explore the Blarney Woolen Mills, and visit Castle
Blarney!).

I won't detail everything we saw, it would get boring for both of us and
there's no point - consult a good travel guide and you'll get better  
writing than I can muster anyway. A couple of tidbits I particularly
enjoyed were seeing Trinity College and the Book of Kells, a stop we
made  
at a working sheep farm (You have no idea what it actually sounds like
to have 1,000 sheep being herded :) ), and a buggy ride through
Kilarney  
National Park with a stop at Castle Ross, whose ruins are still in
remarkably good shape allowing you to wander around, climb the ramparts,
and  
generally get up close and personal in the kind of relaxed way I most
enjoy exploring a place.

My talented wife took about a billion pictures - I took a few as well
but if you see the angle skewed oddly it's probably mine - she has a
real  
eye for composition! You can look at them on

if you like.

Maybe we'll go to Italy next year, if I don't convince her that a nice
relaxing sunny beach vacation on an island somewhere is the way to go :)
