For a long time I have \*wanted\* to be a Safari user...

<!--more-->

But every time I would try I would end up using it for 5 minutes and
then find myself butting heads with a site that's entirely unreadable
using it.

My hard core Mac zealot friends would wave their arms and say "BUT THOSE
SITES AREN'T STANDARDS CONFORMANT!" which is probably true, but there
are times I simply want to be an end user, and web browsing is one of
them.

Happily, with version 1.3 Apple seems to have improved the HTML, CSS and
Javascript rendering support enough that all of the sites that I tested
which used to fail utterly or render useless results under older
versions now work like a charm.

Kudos to Apple for having had the sense to bring their default web
browser for OSX up to the excellent user experience standards exhibited
by the rest of its environment.
