It feels like there are new security issues around WordPress every week.

Admittedly, the fact that WordPress automatically updates itself helps **a lot**, but it does lead one to wonder if a simpler solution might make more sense.

I really like the idea of a static generator tool like `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`__, but also really enjoy blogging from my mobile devices with tools like `Blogsy <http://blogsyapp.com/>`__.

One friend suggested using Pelican, and using Github's built-in editor to create the Markdown, so I suppose I should explore that.

What I would **really**  love to see is a solution where I could compose on my mobile devices in Markdown, then somehow get those changes checked into Github so I could statically generate my blog later from a computer.

Apparently, I want everything :)

A middle of the road solution might be to simply give up and let `Wordpress.com <http://wordpress.com>`__ manage my blog, but I think it's helpful to keep some skin in the game and run my own site given that I build infrastructure for a living.

If anyone reading this has any amazing solutions to the problems I pose here I'd love to hear about it!
