I am being amused watching people run around panicking over the coming snow.

THIS IS NEW ENGLAND PEOPLE. IT SNOWS HERE! GET USED TO IT!

Actually, I'm looking forward to this storm. Unlike the freezing rain and ice issues we've had of late, you can actually frolic and play in the white fluffy stuff and not get yourself killed :)
