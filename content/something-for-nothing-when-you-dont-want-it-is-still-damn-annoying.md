Dear Sun;

When you tell me I hava Java (TM) updates available on my work Windows
machine, I gleefully say sure why not and click through the installer,
because generally Sun provided updates to my installed JDK don't do
anything evil, and with security and all it's a good idea to stay up to
date.

HOWEVER - trying to shoehorn OpenOffice into the mix is downright
annoying, and I resent it.

<!--more-->  
I don't have anything at all against OpenOffice. In fact, it's a Class
A piece of open source software and is damn impressive for what it is,
what it does, and how much it costs (\$0).

However, I and many other users have exactly zero use for OpenOffice
because we have the arguably more powerful Microsoft Office suite
already installed on our machines.

I take no issue with having a little checkbox that says "Hey, want to
get OpenOffice along with Java?" because at least I can check that off
if I want, or not. But having your Java update installer constantly
display ads for OpenOffice, and having it give me **no choice** in the
matter as to whether or not I want the ferschlugging OpenOffice
installer is just wrong.

The software sells itself, Sun, there's no reason to try to sneak it
under the radar of unsuspecting users just because you want to be able
to claim more seats. Last time you tried this with Netbeans, and look at
how well that turned out!

So, get a clue people, really. Truth in advertising, let me do what I
mean and don't try to install software that I need whether I realize it
or not, it just pisses me off.

Grumph, enough ranting for now :)
