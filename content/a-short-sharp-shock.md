One morning a few weeks back I was told to get in early to meet about an
upcoming release that was happening...

Unfortunately, we were in for a big surprise.

Three of my co-workers and I were laid off that morning, along with 23
other unlucky souls from different parts of the lab.

In some sense I can understand the necessity for this kind of overt
deception - there are certainly a non trivial number of people who would
not react well to "Hey, be sure to be in by X time, because we're doing
lay offs and we don't want your tardiness to clog up the gears!", but I
can't help but feel there has to be a better way.

For some reason this one was a bit harder than most for me to accept,
because I loved working at the Broad and had no desire to leave. I don't
harbor any ill will against anyone over it - everyone was just doing
their jobs, and in truth save for my misgivings about leading lambs to
the slaughter like that, I think everyone handled the whole process with
a great deal of professionalism, which is all anyone can ask.

I had the pleasure of working with a bunch of incredibly bright,
talented, friendly people for 4 years. In high tech that's a pretty good
run actually!

So, I'm doing the job search thing again. I chose to eschew the job
placement seminars and such they'd set up for us - I know how to polish
my resume and how to interview, and to my mind that 2 or three days was
much better spent trying to find a soft place for myself to land while
the incredible shrinking job market vaporized before my eyes.

I've been very lucky, things are actually going very well thus far -
I've had 2 first round interviews and one 2nd round, with another set
for today, and two more first round interviews set for tomorrow.

So, we'll see where all of this leads me.

I can't say enough about how amazing my wife has been through all of
this - I'm a very lucky guy indeed :)
